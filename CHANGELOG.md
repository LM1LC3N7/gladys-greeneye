# Changelog

All notable changes to this integration are documented in this file. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project
uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

Describe each change under `## [Unreleased]` as you make it. The Release
workflow moves that section under the version it ships, and the section becomes
the notes of the version's GitHub Release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A working example of scene triggers, scene actions and dashboard widgets
  (Gladys 5.1.0 or later).
- `CHANGELOG.md`, rolled by the Release workflow.
- A GitHub Release for every version, with its changelog section as notes: the
  Gladys Supervision page links each version to the repository's releases.
- CI runs the tests on Node 22 and 24, and builds the Docker image.
- Dependabot keeps the npm dependencies and the GitHub Actions up to date.
- `SECURITY.md` (how to report a vulnerability) and `CLAUDE.md` (project rules
  for contributors and coding assistants).
- Manifest tests: `version` matches `package.json`, `docker_image` is tagged
  with it, descriptions hold 10 to 100 characters, placeholders are
  multi-language objects.
- The latitude and longitude fields show an example value as placeholder.

### Changed

- Node.js 22 or later is required (Node 20 is end-of-life).
- Integration SDK 0.16.0. The tests now run against the fake Gladys of the
  SDK, which refuses the payloads Gladys refuses. A device published with a
  `poll_frequency` is now polled without `should_poll: true` on a recent
  core (an explicit `should_poll: false` opts out); the template keeps the
  field explicit for the older cores.
- The refresh interval is one minute minimum, the fastest Gladys polls a
  device. The plug's power is only sent when it changes, and every 30
  minutes otherwise.

### Fixed

- Gladys refused the devices of the Discovery tab: the weather station and
  the plug declared their poll frequency in seconds instead of one of the
  values Gladys accepts, and were never polled. They now poll every minute,
  and the readings follow the refresh interval of the configuration.

- The release commit no longer fails `npm run format:check`: the Release
  workflow updates the manifest `version` and `docker_image` in place instead
  of re-printing the whole file with `jq`.
- The integration can write to `/data`: the image creates the directory owned
  by the `node` user, a new Docker volume was owned by root.
- A sub-container running the integration's own image follows it to the new
  tag at each release, as well as in the manifest of the build summary: it kept
  the previous tag, which may not exist on the registry. Sub-containers on a
  third-party image (a broker, a database...) keep theirs.
